# Water Balance Transformer

## Overview
This project automates the transformation of raw daily water balance outputs
(from hydrological models or monitoring systems) into structured and reliable
time-series reports.

It converts daily values into:
- Monthly totals
- Calendar yearly totals
- Hydrological year summaries

The tool is designed for engineers and researchers working in
hydrology, water resources, and environmental modeling.

---

## Problem Statement
Hydrological models often generate large daily datasets that are difficult
to analyze directly. Manual aggregation using spreadsheets is time-consuming,
error-prone, and inefficient.

---

## Solution
This application provides a reliable automated workflow that:
- Reads daily water balance data from Excel
- Applies scientifically correct time-aggregation logic
- Produces clean and ready-to-use reports

---

## Features
- Daily → Monthly aggregation
- Daily → Yearly aggregation
- Daily → Hydrological year aggregation
- Excel input/output
- Clear separation between logic and user interface

---

## Technologies
- C#
- .NET Framework
- Microsoft Excel Interop
- Time-series data processing

---

## Use Cases
- Water balance analysis
- Hydrological modeling post-processing
- Research reporting
- Decision-support preparation
